This engine can be used to making games with blazingly fast performance. One of its greatest strenghts is the ability to run modern and heavy stuff in *really* low-end computers, and at the same time extend the capabilities of mid/high-end.

## Features

- Control the entire rendering system by using Draw Calls as objects.
- Complete Scripting API made for preventing hardcoding and making the environment more organized.
- Support for Linux and Windows.
- Multithreading Support.
- Complete 2D and 3D Physics.
- Ultra performance, capable of bringing modern technologies to hardware older than 15 years old.
- The minimum requirement is a 2006 machine.
- The engine is made in C++, so you code in C++.
- Full focus on KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) for experienced programmers and for people that never touched C++.
- Your game/app comes with the engine inside for complete engine control, so you can add features and/or fix bugs for that specific project.
- Complete toolkit for much more simpler compilation process across different IDEs and text editors.
